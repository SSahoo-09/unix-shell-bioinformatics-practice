# Challenges

- My shell-lesson-data stored in "Desktop - Copy" was not being accesible while accessing it through " ls Desktop - Copy "
  - This was because the folder name contained spaces and must be quoted or escaped in the terminal.
  - Otherwise, the terminal thinks you're trying to list three things: Desktop, -, and Copy.
  - So to rectify this I put the line in quotes and I was able to access the data.
