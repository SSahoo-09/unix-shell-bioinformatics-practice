# unix-shell-bioinformatics-practice
This repository contains my learning and practice notes from the **Unix Shell for Bioinformatics** course by [AstroBioMike](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/), a beginner-friendly and highly practical series for those entering computational biology.

# Practice Repository
A personal practice repository for mastering Unix Shell commands in a bioinformatics context. Focused on developing dry-lab skills for genomics and command-line data processing.


## 📚 Course Overview
The course consists of 5 structured modules that guide learners from the basics of navigating Unix systems to handling real biological datasets on HPC environments.

1️⃣Getting started
2️⃣Working with files and directories
3️⃣Redirectors and wildcards
4️⃣Six glorious commands
5️⃣Variables and For Loops

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
Learning to navigate the shell efficiently is key to working on HPCs, scripting pipelines, and managing large NGS datasets.

As a Biological Sciences (+ CS Minor) undergrad, I’m actively working on strengthening my **dry-lab and command-line skills**. Unix Shell is fundamental to:
- Running pipelines on high-performance clusters (HPCs)
- Working with tools like `Bowtie2`, `SAMtools`, and `cutadapt`
- Managing large-scale NGS data effectively

  ## 🚀 Goals

- Master core shell commands
- Write and debug simple bash scripts
- Be comfortable working in Unix-based environments for bioinformatics workflows

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Git Bash
- Nano

  ## 📌 Note

This repo is a **learning space**. Feel free to fork, star ⭐, or refer to it if you're also learning shell scripting for bioinformatics!
