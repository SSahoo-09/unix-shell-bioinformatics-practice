# unix-shell-bioinformatics-practice
This repository contains my learning and practice notes from:
-  **Unix Shell for Bioinformatics** course by [AstroBioMike](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/), a beginner-friendly and highly practical series for those entering computational biology.
-  **The Unix Shell** course by [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), a beginner-friendly and practical series for learning Unix and Bash.

# Practice Repository
A personal practice repository for mastering Unix Shell commands in a bioinformatics context. Focused on developing dry-lab skills for genomics and command-line data processing.


## üìö Course Overview
The course consists of 5 structured modules that guide learners from the basics of navigating Unix systems to handling real biological datasets on HPC environments.

1Ô∏è‚É£Getting started
2Ô∏è‚É£Working with files and directories
3Ô∏è‚É£Redirectors and wildcards
4Ô∏è‚É£Six glorious commands
5Ô∏è‚É£Variables and For Loops

## üß† Why I'm Doing This
Learning to navigate the shell efficiently is key to working on HPCs, scripting pipelines, and managing large NGS datasets.

As a Biological Sciences (+ CS Minor) undergrad, I‚Äôm actively working on strengthening my **dry-lab and command-line skills**. Unix Shell is fundamental to:
- Running pipelines on high-performance clusters (HPCs)
- Working with tools like `Bowtie2`, `SAMtools`, and `cutadapt`
- Managing large-scale NGS data effectively

  ## üöÄ Goals

- Master core shell commands
- Write and debug simple bash scripts
- Be comfortable working in Unix-based environments for bioinformatics workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Git Bash
- Nano

  ## üìå Note

This repo is a **learning space**. Feel free to fork, star ‚≠ê, or refer to it if you're also learning shell scripting for bioinformatics!
